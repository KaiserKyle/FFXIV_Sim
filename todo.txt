Short Term:
- Long and short animation locks: Currently all skills have the same global 0.75 second animation lock.
- Unified logging/verbosity switches: Allow for various verbosity in logging and also have a unified printf call, so this can be controlled globally
- Multiple runs of a simulation: Collect statistical information after n number of runs of a simulation (Note: Will be better if unified logging is done first)
- Positional damage: Currently all positionals are assumed to have been hit
- Compare to striking dummy parse: In theory, solo Dragoon simulation should provide real results. Should take a striking dummy parse and compare notes
- Role skills: Not as important to Dragoon, but important for other classes. Should find a way to keep role skills in their own JSON file and have the class tell us which role skills to load
- Command line args: Currently compiling in options for testing
- More robust rotation definition: Static listing of skills is very limiting
    - Core rotation vs. GCD priorities?

Long Term:
- More classes
- Download and run parse from FFLogs
- Emnity measurements
- Auto update core JSON files from web (when balance patches come out)

Long Term Ideas:
- Allow AI/ML algorithms to create rotation and test
- Party synergy simulations, ability to look at actual contributions from support skills
- Be able to compare two FFLogs and look for most significant differences
- Enemy/full fight simulation
- BiS Solver
- Ability to use library on website?
